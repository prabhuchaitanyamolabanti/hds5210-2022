# Feedback on Final

You did a great job on your final project, combining data from multiple sources and trying to draw some conclusions.  It demonstrated your Python skills well.

One of the requirements for the final was to use functions to modularize your code and make it easier to test and validate.  You didn't make any use of functions in your notebook at all.  Also, remember that variable names need to mean something.  You used `df0`, `df1`, `subdf0`, etc throughout your code.  (-10 on Modularity and Style)

I would have liked to see more explanation throughout the notebook on why you were doing what you were doing, and what you thought the next steps should accomplish.  (-2 Documentation / Professionalism)
